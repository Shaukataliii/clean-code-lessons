# Lessons from the Clean Code book (Robert C. Martin)

### 1- Modularity and Separation of Concerns make new decisions easy.
It is easy to restructure and add new functionalities when the concerns of the system are properly separated.

### 2- Use DSL (domain specific language) where domain persons e.g. Develops, needs to interact with the system and USL (user specific language) where a user needs to interact with the system.

### 3- While designing systems, use the simplest way/technique possible.
